## Problem Statement

Schuster is a multinational retail company specializing in sports goods and accessories. The company conducts substantial business with hundreds of vendors, with whom it has established credit arrangements. However, not all vendors adhere to the agreed credit terms, leading to late payments. While Schuster imposes significant late payment fees, this approach is not conducive to maintaining long-term business relationships. Additionally, some employees are tasked with chasing vendors for timely payments, resulting in non-value-added activities, loss of time, and financial impact. Therefore, Schuster aims to understand its vendors' payment behavior and predict the likelihood of late payments for outstanding invoices.

### The payment process at Schuster:
- Each time goods are transacted with a vendor, the accounting team issues an invoice and shares it with the vendor. This invoice includes details of the goods, the invoice amount, the creation date, and the payment due date based on the contractual credit terms. Given the frequent business transactions with these vendors, there are always multiple invoices associated with each vendor at any given time..

## Business Objective
- Segmenting customers to understand their payment behavior
- Historical data is leveraged, that the company needs to predict delayed payments for an unforeseen dataset of transactions with upcoming due dates.
- The company needs these predictions to enhance resource allocation, accelerate credit recovery, and minimize low-value-adding activities.
